## Environment Setup

Setting up the development environment is one of the most overlooked and oftentimes frustrating part of programming.

The development environment is the set of processes and programming tools used to create the program or software product.

For example:
Node and npm,
Databases,
Text editor,
Command Line Interface

It is important to know what kind of environment you need to run your application properly. When you decide to deploy your application the correct environment has to be set up on the cloud that you are trying to deploy in.

For example:
Digital Ocean,
AWS,
Heroku,
Google Cloud

Instruction to set up correct environment is not always straight forward especially if you’re working with Window or Linux computers. There isn’t a exact links or website that tells you step by step how to setup your environment because environment your application need might be slightly different.

If you are stuck it’s okay because in programming few things ever go as planned in the first try. You will get errors when you are trying to set up environment be sure to google the error and most of the time you will find a helpful guide to follow how to fix the error. Google is your best friend.
